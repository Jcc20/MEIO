# Stocasthic Dynamic Programming and Markovian Processes

This project was divided in two separate parts: 
* firstly, we are faced with a scenario for which we had to find out the best policy to maximize the profit, through the value iteration model, implemented in **JAVA**;
* secondly, we present a comprehensive summary of a scientific paper on the use of multi-state Markov chains in the analysis of Chronic Kidney Disease progression, published in the **Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Biostatistics**.

The assignment was developed in **Stocasthic Methods of Operational Investigation**, in the last semester of the Bachelor's degree (2019/20).
